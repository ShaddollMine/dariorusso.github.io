										<h1>Racing Game (Object-Oriented Programming)</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The project in question is the final coursework with a 4 weeks deadline for a module called Object-Oriented Programming. The name of the module is self-explanatory. It teaches us about Object-Oriented paradigm using Java programming language to apply the concept we learn during the lesson.</p>
									<p>I had to select between 3 programs to implement and implement only one:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A racing videogame</li>
										<li>Stock/Investor program</li>
										<li>Chat Bot</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The one I decided to implement was the racing videogame. I thought I had enough experience in videogames programming, and it would have been much easier to implement Object-Oriented concepts with something I felt comfortable programming.<br>
										The major challenge I had to overcome in this project was Java's way of treating the Graphical User Interface. For this reason, I decided not to use a fancy graphical interface.<br>
										Worth noticing that the university taught me only the OOP concepts such as generalization, dynamic binding, abstraction, etc... and briefly discussed where we should have used them. In my honest opinion, I have not learned OOP since my second year, where we had a module called Software Engineering that properly taught us how to apply Object-Oriented concepts.<br>
									</p>
									<p>Now, let's stop talking about quintessential boring pre-planning and start have a view at the application I produced.</p>

											<div class="col-6"> <p>The main feature is the race. The race algorithm works by paring each car and generates a random number taking into count the car's specific (If a car is more "powerful" than the other, it is more likely to overtake the car ahead or prevent the car behind to overtake). If the score of the car behind is greater than the one ahead, their positions get swapped. Each lab has items you can use; these are items that power up your car or power down the opponent's ones.</p></div>

											<div class="col-6"> <p>In the game, you can create a car with any combination of components you desire. If you are not interested in car manufacturing, you can generate a random car by pressing the random car button. Watch out what part you choose because each component has its strengths and weaknesses.</p></div>
