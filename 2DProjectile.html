										<h1>2D Projectile</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>This is a project I started with my friend during a boring summer period. Our goal was to make a platform game that resembled Hollow Knights style.<br>This is the only project that I would call a failed project as there but for the projectile physics of main character gun.</p>
									<p>Despite it being a failure I really think that this project was essential for me to understand how physicals projects like gravity are implemented in a videogame or in a computer context in general. <br>What I learned is that all the physics formulas like projectile motions I learned during A-levels where not as useless as I though they were.</p>

											<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2DProjectileShow.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-6"> <p>As you can see the projectile motion of the projectile follows the form of projectile motion, the green dot are used to aim, they are prediction of the path the ball is going to follow so that the player can take the aim with the mouse cursor.<br>The velocity of the shot is given by the force applied to the bullet, and the force is increased depending on the distance the cursor has from the player character.</p></div>
										</div>

									<p>I honestly think this is the only relevant piece of code that makes this project stand out from the others, as I never attempt on using mathematical/physical formula in any of my progrraming before this project. I found it very useful and interesting.</p>
									<p>It is worth knowing that before I tried this physical approach, I first was experimentin with parabolas of the form x<sup>2</sup>+yx+c by using the player position as origin and the constant to find a good projetile. However I had small bugs as the bullet kept following a circular path, therefore I changed the way of watching at the problem and went for a physical approach.</p>
