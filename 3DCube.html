										<h1>3D Rotiating Cube</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>After programming a couple of 2D games, I started thinking about how I could program 3D games. I started looking on youtube, and I realized that most good quality videos about 3D graphics explained the topic in C++.<br>However, that was not enough to stop me, and this is how I started watching a video from a youtube channel called: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA">javidx9</a>. He explained the topic well by programming a graphic engine from scratch rather than using an existing one. This way of teaching made me understand well the concepts and mathematics involved behind Graphic engines.</p>
									<p>How matrices are used to program in A 3D space is the concept I liked the most. In my opinion, the matrix that got emphasized the most through the youtube course I followed is the projection matrix. The projection matrix is a matrix that transforms a series of 3D coordinates in a way that they can be visualized in a 2D space. This is performed by multiplying the 3D coordinates with this matrix. The matrix itself is a combination of concepts that takes in count how wide we can see, the distance of the object from the origin, and more.</p>

									<p>Finally, I took these concepts into practice and translated the examples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA">javidx9</a> gave from C++ into Java. And this is how I ended up with a 3D cube.</p>

												<div class="col-6"><p>However, it was somewhat boring, because the cube was static, and couldn't really tell the difference with a 2D cube. So kept following the video and learned about other matrices used to translate, rotate and do every sort of movement with 3D coordinate. So I implemented 2 rotations, one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis, making sure that the rotation was asynchronous, ending with this marvelous effect.</p></div>

									<p>I particularly enjoyed this project and I hope that in the future I will have some free time to expand my knowledge about 3D graphics and how 3D games are implemented.</p>
