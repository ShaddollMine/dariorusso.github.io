										<h2 id="content">Bio</h2>
										<p>
											Hello, my name is Dario, I am an Italian second-year computer science student at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary University of London</a>. My biggest passion, as you might guess, are computers. A passion that I grew over the years.
										</p>

										<p>
											It all started from playing videogames, my first ever game I played was Rayman 3, I really loved that game so much that Rayman became one of my favourite “superhero” for many years. But while I was gaming I always had this question in mind: “How is this piece of metal doing this?"<br> So curious that I took one apart, lucky enough I didn’t break it. Then, I started looking for a way to study it in a “proper way” and picked computer science as my GCSE, then for my A-Levels, and ultimately as my University course.
										</p>

										<p>
											Computer science was not the only thing I loved. While I was studying A-Level physics I discovered the topic of quantum physics and because of my love for computer science with some research and with the help of my physics teacher I discovered quantum computers. I do believe that this is  going to be the future of computers and I would love to be part of that.
										</p>

										<p>
											My biggest dream which isn’t computer science related is to create a time machine; I really hope it is going to work thanks to a computer, so at least I can work and play with it.

										<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Chess</h3>
												<p>I started playing chess in Italy when I was around 9; through a club run by the school. I really enjoy thinking strategically and find this type of thinking somewhat cool, Like: always be 1 step ahead of your enemy and predicting him moves to act accordingly.</p>
												<p>I am not good at playing it, but I always enjoy playing it despite me winning or losing.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Piano</h3>
												<p>I started playing piano at the age of 11, thanks again to the school I attended in Italy. My piano teacher was a strict classical musician that taught me well. All the people that I knew started saying I was talented, which I translated to “I do 1 hour at least each day, I am not talented”. </p>
												<p>Since moving to the UK I don't play as much but I still enjoy playing when I can</p>
											</div>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Programming Videogames</h3>
												<p>As I said I loved playing videogames and I was wondering how the computer worked. Once I started having some knowledge on how it worked, I started using that knowledge into practice and start programming videogame. More about it in the Project section of this portfolio.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Playing videogames</h3>
												<p>I enjoy playing videogames a lot. The game I play the most, over 7 years now, is <a href="https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/">league of legends</a>. A game mainly based on strategy and teamwork. Other games I play are sekiro, dark souls 3, hollow knights, and a lot of other challenging videogames.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Conclusion</h3>
												<p>To wrap up, I am a simple human that wants to grow in the field of computer science and possibly reach his dreams despite how out of the ordinary they might seem.</p>
