										<h1>EuroStar Database</h1>
									</header>
									<p>This group project (3 members) is the combination of two coursework for a module called database and systems.
										 The first part of the coursework consisted of analyzing a scenario provided in a written format and gathering requirements to plan a database schema and a database ER-Diagram.
										 The second part consisted of implementing the database in Oracle SQL following our pre-planning from part one.</p>

									<h2>Part 1</h2>
									<p>The first part consisted of five sub-parts:</p>

									<ol>
										<li>Assumptions: Our team analyzed the Eurostar scenario given to us (download it from here). The Eurostar scenario provided was unclear; we brainstormed over the vague parts of it and made assumptions of what the user was trying to communicate. I got tasked with putting what we agreed on from the brainstorm into words to document our ideas.</li>
										<li>ER-Model: This part consisted of creating the ER-model based on the scenario and the assumption made in part one. I decided to use the Chen Notation and built the following ER-Diagram:</li>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/Database.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<li>Relational Schema: I was, again, tasked with this section. In my opinion, the relational schema section was the easiest out of all the parts as it only required to translate the ER-Diagram into a relational schema.</li>
										<li>ER Model Description: This was a word description of the ER-Diagram. The team member that took this part understood well what he was supposed to do,however, the remainder of the team agreed that his way of exposing things was confusing, therefore, we shared with him our point of view which he agreed on and helped him by giving a template to follow. He happily attempted this part again, producing a much better outcome.</li>
										<li>Normalization up to 3rd normal form: unfortunately, my team member was unsure of the steps required to normalize a database. I helped her by explaining the three normalization steps and checked her final work. In the end, she achieved a superb job, better than I could ever do.</li>
									</ol>

									<h2>Part 2</h2>
									<p>Before popping in the second part, several complaints from the students about the coursework got submitted. The major complaint was about the teams being generated randomly with no substantial criteria. The module organizer solved this by allowing everyone to create their own teams, or stick with the old team.
                     Because of this opportunity, I decided to switch teams and experiment working in a friendly environment by picking two of my friends as team members.
                     Worth noticing that the second part got introduced together with other overwhelming deadlines from other modules.</p>
									<p>The second part was composed of three sub-parts:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Implementing all tables: This was easy to do as I had to follow the design and put it into practice.</li>
										<li>Populate the tables with sample data: one of my teammates was struggling with deadlines, therefore, I helped by populating half of the table I previously created.</li>
										<li>Create a selection of three easy, three medium, and three hard select statements to test the database: In this part, I also had to help my teammates. He easily achieved the easy and medium statements but struggled with hard ones. To solve the problem I guided him on the creation of those types of statements.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>We as a team achieved the maximum score possible in the second part. This taught me that working with people that you know is much easier, productive, and, in general, increases the quality of work. This project made me think that the more experience you have with a team, or people populating that team the better it is for the outcome of the project.</p>
